You are responsible for verifying whether or not and the extent to which your donations are eligible under the HMRC Gift Aid Scheme. To the extent that Donation apply for and/or receive an amount from HMRC in respect of your donations and such amount is found to have been received in error, Donation will be entitled to deduct any such sums from your Notional Account or to require you to make such payment to your Notional Account as may be required to rectify such error. Claims for tax rebates to HMRC are usually submitted monthly and tax credits are shown on statements once the funds have been received by Donation. This normally takes one week from the time the claim is submitted but can take longer.
